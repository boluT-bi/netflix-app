# netflix-app



## Introduction
The goal of this project was to mimic key UI features aswell as some functions that serve to personalise user experience but most importantly to familiarise myself with  front-end languages (javascript,css/sass,html) and python based back-ends used in web app development.The basic idea of my approach follows that if users can create profiles serving as session identifiers, the user-client interactions stored and analysed in the front-end will influence and diversify items shown across profiles.  An external database is used to handle user and user profile creation,updates etc making this a full stack project.
